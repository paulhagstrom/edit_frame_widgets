Description:
    This will generate a widget cell and the views (both for the specific widget
	and for all widgets), as well as the widget tree.
	
	If you pass in child, it will stub out a child frame, intended to be included
	in a parent's frame.  Otherwise, it will stub out a parent frame.
	
	No tests are currently included.
	
	The common views in app/cells/edit_frame_widgets/ can be removed if you don't
	want to change them, Apotomo/Cells will fall back on the (identical) ones within
	the plugin.  If they appear in app/cells/name, they will take priority, if you
	want them to differ from widget to widget.
	
	Read the comments in the stubs for some terse guidance on how to use these.

Example:
    ./script/generate edit_frame_widgets Name [child]

    This will create:
        app/models/application_widget_tree.rb
		app/cells/name_cell.rb
		app/cells/name/_detail.html.erb
		app/cells/name/_frame.html.erb
		app/cells/name/_list.html.erb
		app/cells/edit_frame_widgets/_filter.html.erb
		app/cells/edit_frame_widgets/_message.html.erb
		app/cells/edit_frame_widgets/_selected.html.erb
